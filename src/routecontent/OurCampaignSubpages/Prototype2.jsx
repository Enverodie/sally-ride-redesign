<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>For revision two, our group made revisions to prototype 1 based on critique our class received from the State Department. You can see the revision, the revisor, and the reasoning behind the revisions in the document below.</p>

<h3>The revising process:</h3>
<p>The I101 instructors provided us with a video interview with a State Department representative, where she discussed the things she liked/disliked about various submissions. We tried to revise accordingly.</p>
<p>In order to do this, we made a list of notes in which to tailor our previous post prototypes.</p>
<ul>
    <li>They're trying to keep diversity and inclusion implicit, so they say NOT to use these hashtags/keywords.</li>
    <li>Include handles (Note: Sally Ride Science is an active organization!)</li>
    <li>Avoid colloquialisms; particularly American colloquialisms.</li>
    <li>They love series posts, particularly if there is a story/coherence to it. Chain posts (one post per day/every other day) that explicitly tells that there are more to come, or otherwise date-specific posts are encouraged.</li>
    <li>IF the photo you use is important to the person, you can use the same image across platforms in any given post.</li>
</ul>
