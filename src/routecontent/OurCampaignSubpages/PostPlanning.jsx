<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>This part of the project consisted of creating first drafts of each social media post. We did this by creating six draft posts per group member, two for each social media platform (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter). These images were submitted to our team Discord server. All the submissions can be found below in platform order.</p>
